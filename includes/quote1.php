<p>
    I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer. <br>
    Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. <br>
    I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me. <br>
    And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br> 
    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain.<br>
